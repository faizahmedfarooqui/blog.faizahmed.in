# Why we need this?

Since most of us do not know all the things there is to technology & want to learn them but do not know what/how to ask? So, from now on we will look up at the “[Courses](https://trello.com/b/ugOufjVK/courses)” Trello board, find out the technology we want to learn & start reading the cards available for technology.

# How do we learn?

Each list contains features / important things as cards, and each of these cards contains checklists. Now, these checklists contain the list of items there is to know in the technology. If you can Google it on the Web, Et Voilà! You will find the answers.
