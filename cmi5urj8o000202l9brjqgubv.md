Learn how JavaScript handles BigInt, why the default Number type silently loses precision with large integers, and how to avoid overflow, rounding errors.

JavaScript has two numeric systems:

1. **Number** – a 64-bit floating-point type used everywhere by default.
    
2. **BigInt** – an arbitrary-precision integer type introduced to handle values that Numbers simply cannot represent.
    

Most developers use the `Number` type without thinking much about it, and that’s where subtle bugs creep in. Once your integers grow beyond a certain size such as during cryptographic operations, blockchain transactions, financial calculations, or system-generated IDs.

JavaScript will quietly corrupt these values unless you switch to BigInt intentionally.

This post breaks down how BigInt works, how Number fails, and what happens when you miss the details.

## **1\. The Hard Limits of JavaScript’s Number Type**

JavaScript Numbers follow IEEE-754 double-precision rules.

They can only store integers accurately up to:

```javascript
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER  // 9007199254740991
Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER  // -9007199254740991
```

Anything beyond these values can’t be represented exactly.

### Example

```javascript
9007199254740992 === 9007199254740993  
// true (precision lost)
```

The moment you cross this threshold, JavaScript starts approximating integers using floating-point rounding.

### Where this breaks

* Snowflake-style distributed IDs
    
* Crypto and hashing inputs
    
* Database primary keys
    
* Blockchain units (e.g., Wei)
    
* Financial figures in cents
    
* High-resolution timestamps
    

Precision errors here are dangerous because they’re **silent**. JavaScript won’t warn you.

## **2\. BigInt: Precise Integers for Any Size**

BigInt was introduced to fix this issue by allowing integers without size limits.

### Creating BigInts

```javascript
const a = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
const b = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

### Exact comparisons

```javascript
BigInt("9007199254740993") === BigInt("9007199254740994");
// false (correct)
```

BigInt behaves like a true integer type. No exponent rounding. No overflow.

## **3\. The Trap: JavaScript Never Auto-Converts to BigInt**

A common misconception is that JavaScript will "switch" to BigInt when needed.

It will not.

If you do this:

```javascript
let x = 999999999999999999999999999999;
```

JavaScript outputs:

```javascript
1e+30
```

This is **not** a BigInt. It is a lossy floating-point approximation.

### Real problem: You won’t notice unless you check

* IDs stop matching
    
* Hash inputs change
    
* Database lookups fail
    
* Comparisons return false negatives
    
* Values get rounded, often catastrophically
    

These bugs are notoriously hard to trace.

## **4\. What Actually Happens When You Use Large Integers as Numbers**

### **Case 1: Precision Loss**

```javascript
9999999999999999 === 10000000000000000  
// true
```

Both collapse to the same float.

### **Case 2: Scientific Notation**

Large strings parsed incorrectly:

```javascript
parseInt("8888888888888888888888888888");
// → 8.888888888888889e+30
```

You didn’t ask for floats but you got floats.

### **Case 3: Overflow → Infinity**

```javascript
10 ** 400;
// → Infinity
```

### **Case 4: Logic Errors with No Visible Warning**

Imagine your IDs:

```javascript
const incoming = "1623439434039488512";
const stored = "1623439434039488512";

Number(incoming) === Number(stored);  
// false (or sometimes true for the wrong reason)
```

This breaks authentication, logging, analytics, and distributed systems.

## **5\. How to Correctly Handle Big Integers**

### ✔️ Always treat large integers as strings until conversion

```javascript
const id = BigInt(req.body.userId);
```

### ✔️ Use BigInt literals for constants

```javascript
const MAX = 999999999999999999999n;
```

### ✔️ Never rely on Number for large values

Especially when consuming:

* JSON
    
* API responses
    
* Database IDs
    
* Blockchain RPC data
    

### ✔️ Validate safe integer boundaries

```javascript
Number.isSafeInteger(value)
```

## **6\. “Cannot mix BigInt and Number”: Why JavaScript Throws**

Once you use BigInt, JS becomes strict:

```javascript
1n + 1  
// TypeError
```

**Why?** Because combining Number and BigInt can silently corrupt values.

### Fix

```javascript
1n + 1n;
```

Or explicitly convert (carefully):

```javascript
BigInt(1);  
Number(1n);  // risky for large n
```

## **7\. JSON and BigInt: A Known Limitation**

`JSON.stringify()` does not support BigInt.

```javascript
JSON.stringify(1n);
// TypeError
```

### Workaround

```javascript
JSON.stringify({ value: big.toString() })
```

Or use libraries like:

* `json-bigint`
    
* `lossless-json`
    

## **8\. Real-World Failures Caused by Ignoring BigInt**

### **1\. Broken authentication**

Snowflake IDs cannot be stored as Numbers.  
Users are logged in as someone else or fail auth randomly.

### **2\. Corrupted financial values**

Large cent-level integers lose precision.  
This leads to rounding deviations that cause balance mismatches.

### **3\. Blockchain values break**

Ethereum Wei values exceed `2^53` routinely.  
Contract interactions fail or verify incorrectly.

### **4\. Distributed system IDs mismatch**

Comparisons give unpredictable results when Numbers overflow.

# **Conclusion**

JavaScript’s Number type is convenient, but it is fundamentally limited.

If your application handles anything that exceeds 53 bits or must remain exact, you must consciously use BigInt.

The key takeaways:

* JavaScript will never auto-upcast to BigInt
    
* Large integers silently lose precision
    
* Overflow leads to scientific notation or Infinity
    
* BigInt solves these problems but requires explicit usage
    
* JSON doesn’t support BigInt without custom handling
    

By understanding these details, you avoid hard-to-debug failures in authentication, cryptography, blockchain, analytics, and financial systems.
