# Introduction

In this post, I'll demonstrate how to include Traefik Proxy ‚Äî a cloud native application proxy ‚Äî in our Docker Compose file and use it in our architecture with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin service containers.

I've previously covered Traefik's principles in prior blogs ‚Äî

* [How much do you know "Traefik" proxy?](https://blog.faizahmed.in/how-much-do-you-know-traefik-proxy)
    
* [Traefik + Docker Compose](https://blog.faizahmed.in/traefik-docker-compose)
    

As a baseline, I'm assuming you're familiar with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) & [Traefik](https://blog.faizahmed.in/how-much-do-you-know-traefik-proxy).

Let's get started ‚Äî

I'll share the Docker Compose file, followed by a full analysis of what every line in our template represents.

# Docker Compose

```yml
version: "3.6"
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:v2.9
    container_name: traefik
    command:
      - --api.insecure=true
      - --providers.docker=true
      - --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false
      - --log.level=debug
      - --entrypoints.web.address=:1337
    ports:
      - 1337:1337
      - 9090:8080
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

  postgres:
    container_name: pg_container
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - traefik
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - ./postgres-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
      # - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 87654321
      POSTGRES_DB: testing
    healthcheck:
      test:
        - CMD-SHELL
        - psql -U postgres -d testing
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 50
      start_period: 30s

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    volumes:
      - ./pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - 5050:80
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: faiz@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: 123456
      SCRIPT_NAME: /_admin/pgadmin
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.entrypoints=web
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.service=pgadmin
      - traefik.http.services.pgadmin.loadbalancer.server.port=80
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.rule=(Host(`localhost`) && PathPrefix(`/_admin/pgadmin`))
```

# Details (of the content mentioned in Docker Compose file)

* Replace `localhost` with your own domain or sub-domain in `traefik`, `postgres` & `pgadmin` services
    
* Change config vars against these environment vars in `postgres` service ‚Äî `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` & `POSTGRES_DB`
    
* Change config vars against these environment vars in `pgadmin` service ‚Äî `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL`, `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` & `SCRIPT_NAME`
    
* Run `docker-compose.yml` file by using the command `docker-compose up -d`
    
* Your pgAdmin server should be up and running. Visiting [http://localhost:1337/\_admin/pgadmin](http://localhost:1337/_admin/pgadmin), will show you your pgAdmin portal
    
* You'll need to **register a server** in `pgAdmin` after you successfully login into it with the configs values you used in your `docker-compose.yml` file - just remember to use `pg_container` as the hostname
    
* I'm using official docker images for [PostgreSQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) & [pgAdmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4)
    

## Analysing PostgreSQL service

```yml
  postgres:
    container_name: pg_container
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - traefik
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - ./postgres-data/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
      # - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 87654321
      POSTGRES_DB: testing
    healthcheck:
      test:
        - CMD-SHELL
        - psql -U postgres -d testing
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 50
      start_period: 30s
```

* The **container name** is your **database hostname**, from our template the database hostname is `pg_container`
    
* `depends_on: [traefik]` means we want to wait till `traefik` service is up
    
* `ports` exposes our postgres to accept incoming requests with the postgres port running inside your docker container
    
* `volumes` mapping helps us to keep our data within the database to **persist** in our **local machine**. So, next time when we run our docker-compose from the same location - persisted data from the directory `./postgres-data` will be utilised by our postgres service container and it won't redo all the installation steps
    
* In `volumes`, you see I have commented out this line ‚Äî `# - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql`
    
    * If you would like to do additional **initialization** in an image derived from this one, add one or more `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz`, or `*.sh` scripts under `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` (creating the directory if necessary)
        
    * After the entrypoint calls **initdb** to create the default postgres user and database, it will run any `*.sql` files, run any executable `*.sh` scripts, and source any non-executable `*.sh` scripts found in that directory to do further **initialization** before starting the service
        
    * **Warning**: scripts in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` are only run **if you start the container with a data directory that is empty**; any **pre-existing database** will be left untouched on container startup
        
    * One common problem is that if one of your `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts **fails** (which will cause the entrypoint script to exit) and your orchestrator restarts the container with the already initialized data directory, **it will not continue on with your scripts**
        
* There are lots of other environment vars available in postgres docker image, you can find their references here - [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
    
* I do `healthcheck` with **postgres** container because it takes almost a minute to initialise for the first time and starts accepting connection requests once postgres container is up & this might break my backend apps which would need database connection in their start scripts
    
* You can find **healthcheck** references from the [docker-compose's official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#healthcheck)
    

## Analysing pgAdmin service

```yml
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    volumes:
      - ./pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - 5050:80
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: faiz@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: 123456
      SCRIPT_NAME: /_admin/pgadmin
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.entrypoints=web
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.service=pgadmin
      - traefik.http.services.pgadmin.loadbalancer.server.port=80
      - traefik.http.routers.pgadmin.rule=(Host(`localhost`) && PathPrefix(`/_admin/pgadmin`))
```

* `depends_on: postgres` This statement means that `pgAdmin` service depends on `postgres` and waits until the **healthy** service status is received from the same container and this is how one should use the `postgres` **depends** in their backend app services as well.
    
* If not done as above, your backend will definitely fail most of the times which is not good for your final product
    
* Almost all of the configs speaks for itself except env var `SCRIPT_NAME`
    
* Since I have `traefik` - I wanted to host my **pgAdmin** app on some route & here's how it's done
    
    * Firstly, to do this I had to move **pgadmin** on some route & you can do it by setting the `SCRIPT_NAME` variable
        
    * Once that's done, now rewriting routes uri using **traefik** labels to `/_admin/pgadmin` will do the job
        

Thank You!

# Summary

After reading this article, you will have a fundamental grasp on how to setup **Traefik Proxy** with **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin** in your Docker Compose.

And I strongly advise everyone to have the "health check" docker-compose's index in your postgres service container to avoid unnecessary initialisation failures.
