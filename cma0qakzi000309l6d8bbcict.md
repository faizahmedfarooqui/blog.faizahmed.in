## **Streaming Isnâ€™t Always Smooth!**

**Node.js Streams** are a great way to handle large data without loading everything into memory.

But **without managing flow properly**, you can flood your memory and crash the app.

Enter: **Backpressure**!

## **What is Backpressure?**

Imagine a **water hose** â€” if water flows faster than the outlet can handle, it overflows.

In Node.js:

* **Producer** = Source pushing data (e.g., File Read Stream)
    
* **Consumer** = Destination handling data (e.g., Writing to DB, HTTP Response)
    

**Backpressure** happens when the **consumer is slower than the producer**.

## **How Streams Normally Work (Without Proper Handling)**

Example scenario:

```javascript
const { createReadStream, createWriteStream } = require('fs');

const readable = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

readable.pipe(writable);
```

> `pipe` *automatically* handles backpressure.

**Problem:** If manually handling `.on('data')`, you can break things.

**Bad Manual Handling Example:**

```javascript
readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
  writable.write(chunk); // ðŸš¨ No control if writable buffer fills up!
});
```

* If `writable.write()` returns `false`, you're supposed to **pause** the readable stream.
    
* **If you don't**, you risk memory overflow!
    

## **The Right Way: Managing Backpressure Yourself**

Correct approach:

```javascript
readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
  if (!writable.write(chunk)) {
    readable.pause(); // âœ‹ Pause reading if writable is overwhelmed
  }
});

writable.on('drain', () => {
  readable.resume(); // âœ… Resume once writable buffer is free
});
```

**Explanation:**

* `.write(chunk)` returns `false` if internal buffer is full.
    
* `.pause()` and `.resume()` control the flow to prevent memory pressure.
    

## **When You Get Backpressure For Free:** `pipe()`

The `.pipe()` method **internally** manages backpressure.

**Best practice:** Use `.pipe()` **whenever possible** unless you have special needs.

Example:

```javascript
readable.pipe(writable);
```

* Safe, memory-friendly, easy
    

## **Real-World Example: Uploading Files to S3**

Imagine uploading large video files:

* Read file as a stream.
    
* Upload to S3 as a writable stream.
    
* Must handle backpressure or your server **dies** under heavy load.
    

**Code Sketch:**

```javascript
const { createReadStream } = require('fs');
const { Upload } = require('@aws-sdk/lib-storage');

async function uploadLargeFile(filePath, bucket, key) {
  const fileStream = createReadStream(filePath);

  const upload = new Upload({
    client: s3Client,
    params: {
      Bucket: bucket,
      Key: key,
      Body: fileStream,
    },
  });

  await upload.done();
}
```

* AWS's SDK internally handles backpressure too.
    

## **When Ignoring Backpressure Becomes a Disaster ðŸš¨**

* High memory consumption (visible in `htop`, `pm2`, etc.)
    
* Random server crashes
    
* Slow I/O performance
    
* Increased GC pauses
    

## **Bonus Tip: HighWaterMark Settings**

1. Streams have **internal buffer thresholds**.
    

2. You can configure the size using `highWaterMark`.
    

Example:

```javascript
const readable = fs.createReadStream('largeFile.txt', { highWaterMark: 16 * 1024 }); // 16 KB buffer
```

* **Tune it** based on your system and use case.
    

## **Conclusion: Stream Smart, Stream Safe!**

Node.js Streams are a superpower.

But without **respecting backpressure**, your app can get wrecked.

Understand `.write()`, `.pause()`, `.resume()`, and **always monitor memory** for large transfers.

âœ… Small effort.  
âœ… Huge stability boost.
